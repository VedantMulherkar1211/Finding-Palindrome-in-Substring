# Finding-Palindrome-in-Substring
finding palindrome in substring of more than one string where problem is like:

Problem: Liitle pony has 3 strings A,B and C , Now he selects a non-empty substring a of A, 
a non empty dtring b of B and non empty substring c of C. Consider the string s=a+b+c. Little
Pony wants s to be a palindrome. Here p+q is he cancatenation of p and q.
Help little pony to find if he can selecte some a, b and c so that s is a palindrome.

=> All the string are in lower case.

=> OUTPUT: Return 1 if little pony find palindrome and 0 otherwise.

=>Example Input:  
	input1:
			A:"maccb"
			B:"pccgh"
			C:"absa"
			
	input2:
			A:"a"
			B:"a"
			C:"c"
			
=>Example input1 Explaination:
	One of the possible ways to selected a,b and c is-
		a="accb"
		b="cc"
		c="a"
		s=a+b+c="accbcca" which is a palindrome.
	
=>Output of input1:
		return 1
	
=>Example input2 Explaination:
	We can;t select any valid a,b and c.
	
=>Output of input2:
		return 0
